# Paywall Testing Guide

## Current Issue
The user reported that there's no option to buy a Pro plan or enter payment information.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open the browser console and look for these logs:
- `ðŸ”„ Loading subscription data...`
- `ðŸ“¦ Packages loaded:`
- `ðŸŽ¨ Paywall state changed:`
- `ðŸ‘¤ User status:`

### 2. Test RevenueCat Functions
In the browser console, you can test the RevenueCat functions:
```javascript
// Test getting packages
await window.testRevenueCat.getPackages()

// Test customer info
await window.testRevenueCat.getCustomerInfo()

// Test purchase (mock)
await window.testRevenueCat.purchasePackage('medihub_pro_monthly')
```

### 3. Check User Status
The paywall should only show for non-Pro users. Check if the user's `isPro` status is correct.

### 4. Test Paywall Component
The Dashboard now includes a `TestPaywall` component that shows:
- User status (ID, email, Pro status)
- Package loading status
- Available packages
- Paywall state

### 5. Manual Testing Steps
1. Go to the Dashboard
2. Look for the "Test Paywall" section
3. Click "Test Paywall" button
4. Check if the paywall modal appears
5. Check if packages are displayed
6. Try clicking "Subscribe Now" on a package
7. Check if the payment form appears

### 6. Expected Behavior
- Non-Pro users should see the Pro Features Teaser
- Clicking "Upgrade to Pro" should show the paywall modal
- The paywall should display monthly and yearly packages
- Clicking "Subscribe Now" should show a payment form
- Mock purchases should update the user's Pro status

### 7. Common Issues
- **No packages shown**: Check if RevenueCat is initialized properly
- **Paywall not appearing**: Check if user is already Pro
- **Payment form not showing**: Check if packages are loaded correctly
- **Purchase not working**: Check browser console for errors

### 8. Environment Variables
The system works with mock data if `VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY` is not set.
For real RevenueCat integration, set:
```
VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… Paywall component created
âœ… Mock RevenueCat implementation
âœ… Package display
âœ… Payment form
âœ… User status tracking
âœ… Database schema for subscriptions
âœ… Test component for debugging

The paywall should now be fully functional with mock data for testing.
